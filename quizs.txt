[99FF00] [-] 

An object goes from one point in space to another. After it arrives at its destination, its displacement is:
[99FF00]1.[-] either greater than or equal to
[99FF00]2.[-] always equal to
[99FF00]3.[-] either less than or equal to
[99FF00]4.[-] not related to the distance it traveled.
3. either less than or equal to
Displacement can be negative, and when it is, it is less than
distance, which is the absolute value of displacement!


A skydiver is falling straight down, along the negative
y direction. During the initial part of the fall, her speed
increases from 16 to 28 m/s in 1.5 s. What sign are
the velocity and acceleration?
v<0, a<0


During a later part of the fall, after the parachute has
opened, her speed decreases from 48 to 26 m/s in 11 s.
Which of the following is correct?
1) v>0, a>0
2) v>0, a<0
3) v<0, a>0
4) v<0, a<0
3) v<0, a>0
If speed is increasing, v and a are in same direction.
If speed is decreasing, v and a are in opposite direction.


A ball is thrown straight up in the air and returns to its initial position.
For the time the ball is in the air, which of the following statements is
true?
1 - Both average acceleration and average velocity are zero.
2 - Average acceleration is zero but average velocity is not zero.
3 - Average velocity is zero but average acceleration is not zero.
4 - Neither average acceleration nor average velocity are zero.
3 - Average velocity is zero but average acceleration is not zero.
Free fall: acceleration is constant (-g)
Initial position = final position: Δx=0
ave vel = Δx/ Δt = 0


An object is dropped from rest. If it falls a distance D in time t
then how far will if fall in a time 2t ?
1. D/4
2. D/2
3. D
4. 2D
5. 4D
4. 2D
Correct x=1/2 at2


An object is dropped from rest. If the object has speed v at
time t then what is the speed at time 2t ?
1. v/4
2. v/2
3. v
4. 2v
5. 4v
4. 2v
Correct v=at


A ball is thrown downward (not dropped) from the top of a
tower. After being released, its downward acceleration will
be:
1. greater than g
2. exactly g
3. smaller than g
2. exactly g
after the ball is released, it is only being accelerated by gravity, the throw just sets the initial velocity


A ball is thrown vertically upward. At the very top of its
trajectory, which of the following statements is true:
1. velocity is zero and acceleration is zero
2. velocity is not zero and acceleration is zero
3. velocity is zero and acceleration is not zero
4. velocity is not zero and acceleration is not zero
3. velocity is zero and acceleration is not zero
At the top of the path, the velocity of the ball is
zero,but the acceleration is not zero. The velocity at
the top is changing, and the acceleration is the rate at
which velocity changes.


Without air resistance, an object dropped from a plane
flying at constant speed in a straight line will
1. Quickly lag behind the plane.
2. Remain vertically under the plane.
3. Move ahead of the plane
2. Remain vertically under the plane.
There is no acceleration along
horizontal - object continues to
travel at constant speed (same as
that of the plane) along horizontal.
Due to gravitational acceleration
the object’s speed downwards
increases.


An object is held in place by friction on an inclined surface. The
angle of inclination is increased until the object starts moving. If
the surface is kept at this angle, the object
1. slows down
2. moves at uniform speed
3. speeds up
4. none of the above
3. speeds up
When the object is at rest net force on it is zero.
When the object starts to move there is change in velocity - i.e.,
there is acceleration or a net force due to gravity
The force remains constant when inclination is kept at that angle
leading to constant acceleration - continuous speed up.
